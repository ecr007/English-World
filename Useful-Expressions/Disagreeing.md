# Disagreeing

## Normal Disagreeing

- I know what you're saying, but...
- I see what you mean, but...
- Yes, (that may be true), but...
- I'm not so sure about that.

## Disagreeing More Strongly

- I'm afraid I disagree.
- Sorry, but I disagree.
- That's (just) not true
- I (totally) (completely) disagree.

Afraid: ```Afreid``` feeling fear, or feeling worry about the possible results of a particular situation.

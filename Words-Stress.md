# Words Stress or Stressed Syllables

In English, stress is the emphasis or prominence given to a syllable or word within a sentence or phrase. When speaking, some syllables or words are pronounced with greater force or intensity than others, making them stand out in a sentence. These stressed words or syllables can change the meaning or intention of the sentence, depending on how they are emphasized.

In multi-syllable words, one syllable is usually stressed more than the others. The stressed syllable is usually louder, longer, and higher in pitch. In contrast, the unstressed syllables are softer and shorter.

Here are some general rules for word stress in English:

**Nouns, adjectives, and adverbs: In many two-syllable words, the stress falls on the first syllable.**

Example: "BÁby" (noun), "HÁppy" (adjective), "QUickly" (adverb)

**Verbs: In two-syllable verbs, the stress often falls on the second syllable.**

Example: "beLIEVE" (verb), "reLAX" (verb)

**Words with suffixes: When a suffix is added to a word, the primary stress usually remains on the root or base word.**

Example: "deCIde" (verb) -> "deCIsion" (noun), "comPLETE" (adjective) -> "comPLETEly" (adverb)

**Compound words: In compound words, the primary stress is often on the first word.**

Example: "BLACKbird," "HIGHway," "WATERfall"

**Prefixes: In words with prefixes, the primary stress is usually on the base word.**

Example: "unHÁPPY," "reDO," "prePARE"

**Function words: Some small function words (articles, prepositions, pronouns, etc.) are typically unstressed in a sentence.**

Example: "the," "of," "to," "and," "it," "I," "you," etc.

Remember that word stress is an essential aspect of English pronunciation and can affect how native speakers understand you. Practicing and mastering word stress can greatly improve your spoken English clarity and fluency.
